# artificial-life-teaching-materials

This repository is for lecture slides, exercises, assessments, exam
questions for teachers and students of Artificial Life. All
contents of this repository are UNLICENSED -- they are available to be
used for essentially any purpose as described in the LICENSE.md file.

The structure of the repo is expected to adapt over time, but we will
start with the following simple structure:

**collections** contains materials for running entire courses. So far,
  these include a set of lecture slides. In the future, we may try to
  separate out the lecture slides from the labwork/practical exercises.

**exercises** contains exercises that can be used for experience-based
  learning (and in some cases assessment).

# instructions

When adding new materials, please include a README.md at the base of
the newly added folder. For instance, there should be one at
/collections/dipaolo-adaptive-systems/README.md
