# artificial-life-teaching-materials
Lecture slides, exercises, assessments, exam questions for teachers and students of Artificial Life.

**collections** contains materials for running entire courses. So far,
  these include a set of lecture slides. In the future, we may try to
  separate out the lecture slides from the labwork/practical exercises.

**exercises** contains exercises that can be used for experience-based
  learning (and in some cases assessment).

# instructions

When adding new materials, please include a README.md at the base of
the newly added folder. For instance, there should be one at
/collections/dipaolo-adaptive-systems/README.md
