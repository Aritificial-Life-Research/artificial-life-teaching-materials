# artificial-life-teaching-materials

This repository is for lecture slides, exercises, assessments, exam
questions for teachers and students of Artificial Life. All
contents of this repository are UNLICENSED -- they are available to be
used for essentially any purpose as described in the LICENSE.md file.

The structure of the repo is expected to adapt over time, but we will
start with the following simple structure:

**collections** contains materials for running entire courses. So far,
  these include a set of lecture slides. In the future, we may try to
  separate out the lecture slides from the labwork/practical exercises.

**exercises** contains exercises that can be used for experience-based
learning (and in some cases assessment).

In addition, here are some links to other websites, repositories etc., that you
may find useful when teaching ALIFE related topics.

- https://github.com/IsaacLab/LaboratorioIntangible Materials from a Summer
  School Workshop on Cognition. Contains _Python_ and _Processing_ projects on
  emergence, self-organization, evolution, criticality, and network
  dynamics. Instructions are in Spanish.

- http://mypage.iu.edu/~rdbeer/#software Randy Beer's relased software,
  including a C++ implementation of Continuous-Time Recurrent Neural Networks
  (CTRNN) and an evolutionary algorithm (TSearch)

When adding new materials, please include a README.md at the base of
the newly added folder. For instance, there should be one at
/collections/dipaolo-adaptive-systems/README.md
